ShellVer1.c: Contains very basic functionalities of a shell like reading and parsing single command input, executing two 
builtins (cd and exit) and executing commands based on binaries in the linux filesystem.

ShellVer2.c: Introduces I/O redirection, i.e, reading input for a command from a file and writing output of a command into a file.

ShellVer3.c: Introduces Command Piping, allowing the user to construct a pipeline of commands where the output of each command 
is passed as the input for the next command in the queue.

ShellVer4.c: Cleaner code, with better Error Handling.
